Reasons for functions:
Modularity: single large or complex mechanism can broken down into manageable pieces

Reusability: DONT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)

Maintainability: clear organization, easier to diagnose problems
Functions should do ONE thing
Single source of truth
Don't define functions within other functions

Debugging: automatically unit test functions
